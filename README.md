# CompanyDataApp is a program for The Leatherhead Club Ltd.
It is designed to allow the logging of information as follows:
- Health & Safety information such as daily fridge temperatures and Tax information such as money made
- Reduce unecessary employer-employee communication by acting as a hub of information about their role such as open/close procedures, or event information.

The need of this app is for helping new workers settle in to the idiosyncrasies of the job while ensuring legal information for employers is kept together and is not easily lost.

Version 1 (Completed) [Java]
- data can be stored with a title and either text or checkbox. It is kept in lists and sublists.
- data is easily accessed either by the day in a "Calendar" it relates to, or from the "Today" data-log list.
- must be accessed via the Java terminal and lacks interface.

Version 2 (In Progress) [Javascript]
- Version 1 Java Backend has been converted to equivalent Javascript OOP.
- added frontend interaction to allow computationally clear and simple exchange of data from user to frontend to backend to data-store.
- application interface to follow user-requirements and create accessible way of interacting with the data-log.
